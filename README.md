# petprojects

Hi! This is where I add my random non-academic projects.

1. Graph cypher: this project uses public-key cryptography and graph theor to encrypt text as a graph. The theory behind it was taked from "Graphics and Computation for Engineering Design" by Baizhu et al. (https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6614172).
