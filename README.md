Hi! This is where I add my non-academic projects.

1. üìà [Automatic reporting](https://github.com/arina19-2000/petprojects/tree/main/Automatic%20reporting%20): this is a work project for improving data analysis of the Oracle IDR, an ML tool for scanning invoice information from PDFs. This report is originally produced in an uneditable .xlsx, but I took the .xml version of it and detected patterns for performing data cleaning, parsing, and automatic infographics creation. This script has allowed to significantly speed up the business analytics processes by giving a helicopter view on supplier invoices with good recognition rates, as well as those which required additional work to fully digitize the AP flows. 
The supplier data is anonymized.
   
2. üßµ[Graph cypher](https://github.com/arina19-2000/petprojects/tree/main/Graph%20cypher): this project uses public-key cryptography and graph theory to encrypt text as a graph. The theory behind it was taked from ["Graphics and Computation for Engineering Design" by Baizhu et al.](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jmath/2021/6614172/).
