# pet projects🐱

Hi! This is where I add my non-academic projects.

1. 🧵Graph cypher: this project uses public-key cryptography and graph theory to encrypt text as a graph. The theory behind it was taked from ["Graphics and Computation for Engineering Design" by Baizhu et al.(https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jmath/2021/6614172/)].
